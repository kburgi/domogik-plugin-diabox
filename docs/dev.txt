Interval limitation
===================

The refresh limitation of 60 seconds between 2 requests for the same diabox station is hard coded.
It's simply to prevent user to be too greedy... a so prevent server overloading.

How to add a new diabox station 
===============================

That's quick easy : 
* Edit the info.json and add your device with his sensors
* Edit the lib/diaboxconfig.py and add your station on top of the file

Each diabox station has her own config (remote identifier and remote variable name). That's why there is no common variable.

Wind unit : knot
================

The diabox are commonly used by sailors, so the wind speed unit is in *knots (kts)* by default. If you want to have it in km/h, you must multiply this value by 1.835

* Example : 25 knots x 1.835 = 46 km/h

xPL messages
============

xpl-stat
--------

The **sensor.basic** message is used: ::

    xpl-stat
    {
    ...
    }
    sensor.basic
    {
    type=<one of these sensors : temperature, humidity, windspeed, winddirection, pressure, rainrate>
    device=<device_uid>
    current=<value>
    }

xpl-trig
--------

n/a

xpl-cmnd
--------
